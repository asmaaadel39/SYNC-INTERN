**First Project "Create a simple chatbot using python""**

Chat bots can provide real-time customer support and are therefore a valuable asset in many industries. When you understand the basics of the ChatterBot library, you can build and train a self-learning chatbot with just a few lines of Python code.

ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a user’s input. ChatterBot uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses. This makes it easy for developers to create chat bots and automate conversations with users.

**Second Project "Boston House Price Prediction using python"**

This project is focusing on predicting the price of house in boston, given a set of features that describe the house.
I had solved this problem using Linear Regression model, in the dataset each row is describing a town or suburb in boston city.
I will improved this model next week using some advanced techniques.


**Third Project "Face Mask Detection using python"**

During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this tutorial we will develop a machine learning project , Given an input image, our face mask detection model should be able to detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not with a good amount of accuracy.

To successfully complete this project, there are three major parts we need to think about:

Part 1: Create a training dataset – We should be able to create a training dataset of face images with proper bounding boxes of human faces and annotations indicating whether the person is wearing a face mask or not.

Part 2: Train an image classification model – We should be able to create an image classification model like a Convolutional Neural Network for face mask detection. The accuracy of detection heavily relies on the type and quality of the model we will be building.

Part 3: Make predictions – We should be able to detect faces on images and make predictions on whether or not the person is wearing a face mask using our trained image classification model.

**Fourth Project "Sign Language Classification using python"**

Sign language is manual communication commonly used by people who are deaf. Sign language is not universal; people who are deaf from different countries speak different sign languages. The gestures or symbols in sign language are organized in a linguistic way. Each individual gesture is called a sign.

We will classify the sign language symbols using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After successful training of the CNN model, the corresponding alphabet of a sign language symbol will be predicted.
