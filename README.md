**First Project "Create a simple chatbot using python""**

Chat bots can provide real-time customer support and are therefore a valuable asset in many industries. When you understand the basics of the ChatterBot library, you can build and train a self-learning chatbot with just a few lines of Python code.

ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a userâ€™s input. ChatterBot uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses. This makes it easy for developers to create chat bots and automate conversations with users.

**Second Project "Boston House Price Prediction using python"**

This project is focusing on predicting the price of house in boston, given a set of features that describe the house.
I had solved this problem using Linear Regression model, in the dataset each row is describing a town or suburb in boston city.
I will improved this model next week using some advanced techniques.
